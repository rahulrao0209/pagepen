        <h2>Why use TypeScript?</h2>
        <p class="para">
          Over 20 years after its introduction to the programming community,
          JavaScript is now one of the most widespread cross-platform languages
          ever created. Starting as a small scripting language for adding
          trivial <span>interactivity to webpages</span>, JavaScript has grown
          to be a language of choice for both frontend and backend applications
          of every size. While the size,
          <b>scope, and <span>complexity</span></b> of programs written in
          JavaScript has grown exponentially, the ability of the JavaScript
          language to express the relationships between different units of code
          has not. Combined with JavaScript's rather peculiar runtime semantics,
          this mismatch between language and program complexity has made
          JavaScript development a difficult task to manage at scale. The most
          common kinds of errors that programmers write can be described as type
          errors: a certain kind of value was used where a different kind of
          value was expected. This could be due to simple typos, a failure to
          understand the API surface of a library, incorrect assumptions about
          runtime behavior, or other errors. The goal of TypeScript is to be a
          static typechecker for JavaScript programs - in other words, a tool
          that runs before your code runs (static) and ensures that the types of
          the program are correct (typechecked).
